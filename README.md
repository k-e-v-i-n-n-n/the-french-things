    When you're ready, click the translate button at the bottom and your translation will run.

    If you'd like to save this translation, click the save button and select the type--either an expression or word.

Stars

    On the stars page, you can add a new category to your category list. And you can click an individual category to display all the words youve starred under that category. To remove a category, click the x on the category you'd like to remove.
